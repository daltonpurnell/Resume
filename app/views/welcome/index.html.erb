            <h1>PROFESSIONAL</h1>
            <p>I am currently an iOS developer at a digital design and development studio.
            I help build apps for a large variety of clients and get to use several different languages
            and technologies daily.</p>

            <p>I studied fine art at Brigham Young University and have a passion for -- and the artistic skill to create -- exceptional user experience and design. </p>
            <p>Head over to my <%= link_to "Experience", experience_index_path %> page for more details on my professional experience and past projects.</p>

            <h1>PERSONAL</h1>
            <p>I love creating things.  In my free time I draw, paint, and do some woodworking.
              I find great pleasure in seeing my ideas go from my concept to reality. </p>

            <p>I live in Utah with my wife and 3 adorable children and love to spend time with them whenever I can.</p>
